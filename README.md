# Arduino-Joystick-RGB-LED-Color-Mixer
This Arduino sketch is a Joystick-controlled RGB LED color mixer. It allows you to adjust the red, green, and blue components of an RGB LED using a joystick.

üîç How it works
1Ô∏è‚É£ Hardware setup

Joystick:

VRx ‚Üí A0 (horizontal, unused here)

VRy ‚Üí A1 (vertical, controls color intensity)

SW ‚Üí 2 (push button, switches color channel)

RGB LED (common cathode assumed):

RED ‚Üí pin 9

GREEN ‚Üí pin 10

BLUE ‚Üí pin 11

2Ô∏è‚É£ Program flow

Setup:

Initialize joystick button as INPUT_PULLUP.

Initialize RGB pins as OUTPUT.

Start Serial Monitor to display RGB values.

Set initial color to medium gray (128,128,128).

Loop:

Read joystick vertical axis (y = analogRead(VRy)).

Check joystick button press to cycle the mode:

0 = adjust red

1 = adjust green

2 = adjust blue

Determine adjustment (delta = ¬±5) based on vertical movement.

Constrain the color value between 0 and 255.

Update the RGB LED with analogWrite().

Print the current RGB values to Serial Monitor for debugging.

3Ô∏è‚É£ What you‚Äôll see

Moving joystick up or down changes the intensity of the selected color.

Pressing the joystick button switches the color channel.

Serial Monitor shows current R, G, B values.
